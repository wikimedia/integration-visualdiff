* The directory names are self-explanatory.
  Copy the files in those directories to the corresponding
	directories on the server.

* Dump the databases on the server and migrate over and recreate
  the databases.

	$ mysqldump --all-databases > all-databases.sql
	$ .. scp/rsync this file to the new server

	On the new server, recreate all databases from this sql dump

* The mysql database passwords are all elided from these config files.
  Edit the configs and add in the password once the mysql databases
	have been created.

* There is an mediawiki access token in /home/testreduce/.mw-api-access-token
  that should be migrated over from the old VM to the new VM
