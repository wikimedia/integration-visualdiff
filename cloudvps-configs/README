* setup_vm.sh has all the commands you need to run
  You need to set the PASSWORD for the testreduce user.
	You need to set the name of the mysql dumps file.

* The directory names are self-explanatory.

* Dump the databases on the server and migrate over and recreate
  the databases.

	$ mysqldump --all-databases > all-databases.sql
	$ mv all-databases.sql /srv

	When you recreate a new VM, you are likely going to unmount /srv
	and detach that volume from the old VM and attach it to the new VM.
	This will avoid the necessity to scp/rsync.

	On the new server, recreate all databases from this sql dump

* The mysql database passwords are all elided from these config files.
  Edit the configs and add in the password once the mysql databases
	have been created.

* There is a mediawiki access token in /home/testreduce/.mw-api-access-token
  that should be migrated over from the old VM to the new VM
