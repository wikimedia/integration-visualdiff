Notes about retrying

Once a test run finishes, here is the order in which to try thing:

* bash purge_404s.sh $DB $DB_PASSWORD
* bash retry_significant_failures.sh $DB $DB_PASSWORD
* bash retry_all_regressions.sh $DB $DB_PASSWORD
* bash retry_significant_regressions.sh $DB $DB_PASSWORD

You could retry the last one a few times, if needed.

The trick to automating these is to add an API endpoint to testreduce
which can be queried to figure out if we are at > 99.9% completion.
