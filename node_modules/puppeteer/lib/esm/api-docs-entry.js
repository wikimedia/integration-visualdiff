 * This file re-exports any APIs that we want to have documentation generated
 * for. It is used by API Extractor to determine what parts of the system to
 * document.
 *
 * We also have src/api.ts. This is used in `index.js` and by the legacy DocLint
 * system. src/api-docs-entry.ts is ONLY used by API Extractor.
 *
 * Once we have migrated to API Extractor and removed DocLint we can remove the
 * duplication and use this file.
